		<p> Hi, I’m David. </p>

		<p> I have previously worked as a Technical Analyst at Altria in Richmond, which is where I interned and worked directly out of college. </p>

		<p> I went to college at UVA, where I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science. </p>

		<p> Professionally, I focused on system improvement, using my knowledge of technology to suggest changes that would facilitate various processes. Additionally, I was responsible for the development and oversight of the implementation of these suggestions. </p>

		<p>Outside of work, I like to travel and meet new people. I tend to travel alone since I’ve realized that’s the best way to get out of your comfort zone. I also enjoy playing piano and writing music. I’ve gotten part time gigs playing at hospitals in various cities in which I’ve lived. I also like photography and have gotten somewhat proficient at software such as Photoshop to realize some creative visions that I have. </p>
