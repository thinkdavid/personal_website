<h2>Home</h2>

<p>I’ve always loved when old friends have come to visit me in the variety of places I’ve lived. I haven’t moved that much in my life, just three times, and I’ve had time to build solid relationships in every place I’ve ever lived. It’s always great to see those old friends again and just reminisce over good times.</p>

<p>When I say that I have friends visiting from “home,” I usually mean from my hometown of Norfolk, VA. But then when we hang out all together, no matter what location we’re in it always “feels like home.”</p>

<p>And I’m sure after I live in another place for as long as I lived in Norfolk, I’ll start referring to that as “home” as well. And when I hang out from friends from there, it’ll “feel like home”. Except a different home. But at this point what’s the difference?</p>

<p>Of course you get attached to a place, but what really makes a place is the people you meet there. The experiences you share with people in that place. And when you connect with those people in different places you always relive a sense of that “home.”</p>

<p>When my friends from my hometown, Norfolk, VA, visited in Charlottesville, VA, it felt like I was home again. As in the Norfolk home. </p>

<p>When my friends from Charlottesville visited me in Norfolk, it felt like I was home again. As in the Charlottesville home.</p>

<p>When I studied abroad and my friends from Australia visited me in Charlottesville, it felt like I was home again. Back in Australia.</p>

<p>Home is everywhere I’ve ever been. And at the same time it’s nowhere at all.</p>
