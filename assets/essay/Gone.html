<h2>Gone</h2>

<p>I tried to kill her. The memory, at least.</p>

<p>In a sense, I’m jealous of my phone, of my laptop, of the <em>cloud</em>. They can store memories indefinitely and in perfect resolution, while my memories tend to fade into idealistic representations of what really happened. They remember every detail, as it was recorded, down to the bit. All the happy times can be constantly replayed as they were captured, in the form of pictures or videos. Frozen in those moments. Capturing the emotions of the time. Unaltered by whatever happened before or afterwards. They simply ignore everything else, and all that’s left is that one moment in time, and the emotions of that one moment in time.</p>

<p>But that’s not the main reason why I’m jealous. </p>

<p>Just as they can remember the happy times so perfectly, they can forget. </p>

<p>When I look back at those <em>happy</em> memories, they’re all poisoned by the events that happened afterwards. Events I can’t forget. A person that was so ingrained into me that forgetting them involves losing a part of myself. </p>

<p>My phone can forget. My computer can forget. The cloud can let go.</p>

<p>After all the media is deleted (after a confirmation) it’s gone forever. And the technology is ignorant as to why, ignorant to the pain that those pictures now cause. All it knows is that those pictures show two happy people, in a happy time. </p>

<p>But I get no such joy from any reminders. Not anymore.</p>

<p>And try as I can, I can’t forget either.</p>
