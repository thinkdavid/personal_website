<h2>Mirror Image</h2>

<p>I just got out of the most intense relationship of my life. Like the one of the ones where you love the other person more than you love yourself. Where the things you want take a backseat to what they want. Not in a way where you feel like you’re sacrificing either — you just want them to be happy, and that makes you happy.</p>

<p>It ended terribly.</p>

<p>So I’m trying to figure out where it all went wrong. How could something that seemed so perfect to me (even when it wasn’t) devolve into a point where I find myself actively working to not hate the other person? How did it get to a point where I think I’d be better off if I didn’t see or hear from them ever again?</p>

<p>Naturally, I think people try to blame themselves. Try to find out what we did wrong. And this can usually be unnecessarily harsh. I mean nobody is perfect.</p>

<p>So I’ll start with things I could have done better, or things I did wrong. Firstly, my ex seemed to think that I cheated on her (I don’t know if she actually believes it or not but she said so, so here we are). So I started thinking, what could I have possibly done to make her think that I actually cheated on her. When I thought back, nothing jumped to mind. I had never been physical with any other girl, I was pretty transparent about her the whole time (everyone knew who my girl was and if they didn’t, I would tell them). Maybe it was just my personality. I wondered if maybe I flirted too much and didn’t realize it. It’s possible, I was used to being single, and I talk a LOT, and most of the time it can be seen as flirty. But I certainly didn’t mean to. And I’d never have chosen someone else over my ex. There is no doubt in my mind that I never considered that someone else was better for me. So if she thinks I cheated, I must’ve given someone the wrong impression. Which I guess is something to work on. Maybe I’ll just have to keep an active eye on the flirting, even though to me it means nothing, and I don’t even think I notice what I’m doing.</p>

<p>When it turned into a distance relationship, I was definitely self-conscious about the whole thing, and I wonder if that had something to do with it too. I had varying levels of comfort with some of the things she did while she was away from me, and although I trusted her, maybe I turned it into a situation I shouldn’t have. But then again, I also have the right to express what makes me uncomfortable, and thinking back I’m not sure that I was wrong to be uncomfortable - but maybe I could’ve expressed it differently. I definitely made her feel bad about some of the things she did, and I’m not going to say that wasn’t my intention, but I guess I didn’t realize the affect of doing that. I just wanted her to understand that what she was doing was really difficult to me.</p>

<p>But at the same time, when I realized that I was ruining her fun, and making her miserable by my being uncomfortable, I tried to find a middle ground. I didn’t mention everything that made me uncomfortable, and if I did I actively tried to not make her feel terrible about it. When I realized she didn’t really want to compromise and was still sad about not being able to do everything she wanted to do, I started coming to the conclusion that we couldn’t work apart. At least not in combination with the nature of our distance relationship.</p>

<p> Everything was good when we were together, and it wasn’t always like this, but the distance definitely caused the break up. But with all that being said, I don’t think that’s how we got to where we are now. I always understood her, so even as I was super sad about the relationship ending, I knew how difficult (well I thought) it was for her as well, and I mean how can you hate someone for following their dreams?</p>

<p>We got to where we are now because of everything that happened <em>after</em> we broke up. And I honestly think looking in the mirror, that although I’m not perfect, I know what I did, and I can live with it, because I know that I tried, and I know how much I cared.</p>
