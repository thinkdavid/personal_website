			<h3>Getting around:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Taxis here use meters and are everywhere, just ask to use them if they don’t turn them on</li>
				<li>Download <em>Didi</em> from the app store. It’s like uber for Colombia. Cheaper than taxis, but taxis just know the city so well its fun in a way to tell them your complex and they just know how to get there no problems no questions asked.</li>
				<li>Download <em>Rappi</em> from the app store. It’s like uber eats for Colombia. But better. You can even buy beer/liquor from here.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Neighborhoods</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>El Poblado - Where all the expats live. Super nice area though. A lot of nice bars here, walking around is super cool because of all the nature around (big trees/rivers through the city) that made it almost seem like you were in a jungle</li>

			<h3>Things to Do:</h3>
			<p>I unfortunately couldn’t do too much in Medellin because it was shut down due to COVID. So these will be things I was suggested to do by my Paisa friends.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Guatapé - I actually went here. Rent a car (or take a bus) and its cool to see a more quaint village in Antioquia. Beautiful views from around there. A good hostel to stay in would be <strong>Casa Encuentro - check this</strong></li>
				<li><strong>that park where you take the cable car</strong></li>
				<li>Comune 13 (trece) - Graffiti tour. Go during the day, it’s a bad neighborhood.</li>
				<li>Haciendo Napoles - former home of Pablo Escobar. Now it is a zoo. Interesting if you care about Narcos.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Good for Food and Drink</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Carmen</strong>: Top tier food. Expensive for Medellin but VERY good. From the staff, to the presentation, to the ambience, definitely worth going to if you want a fancy dinner you can’t afford in the US.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Good for Food</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>El Taxista</strong>: Hole in the wall restaurant only open in the morning and afternoon. Super cheap. Super good. One of the places that has a fixed menu and just gives you a tray of food.</li>
				<li>that place that lucas recommended that was supposedly just like el taxista</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Good for Drink</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><em>that place with the arsenal beer i went to w lucas y laura</em></li>
				<li><em>place i went with that girl with a baby</em></li>
				<li><em>place i went with peru</em></li>
				<li><em>fancy pool i snuck into</em></li>
			</ul>
